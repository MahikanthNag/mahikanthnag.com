						<h2>Why am I Passionate about Computer Science ?!!</h2>
					</header>
					<br>
					<p style="font-family: Roboto">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhenever I play around
						with Google Assistant or an e-commerce site suggests me products I like, my amazement is always out of bounds. Let
						me explain it further: My early years of graduation, engendered in me the passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine
						Learning. Hardly much had been discussed about it in our under graduation except for the basics. So, I developed the
						zeal in me to pursue masters in this field of technology. I went through videos of Professor Patrick Winston (MIT),
						and his work in this field not only amazed me but also elucidated the kind of impact Artificial Intelligence will have
						in day to day lifestyle of humans probably in the near future. During and after graduation, I would thus like to contribute
						to research in the same domain.
					</p>
					<div ng-if="hide==false">

						<span id="text" style="font-family: Roboto">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRecently
							I worked on a very simple Artificial Intelligence project just to get the taste of it. It is a Facebook Messenger
							Bot named “Git Talks”, which texts me details about any changes made on my GitHub account. I can also manually type
							questions asking about my profile and get immediate responses!! I always have this feeling that there is nothing that
							brings more happiness to me than seeing my program work. <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“The
							simpler it makes, the better it helps” is something I have been following whenever I brainstorm ideas for a good project.
							Most of the projects I did in my bachelors have not produced extraordinary results but surely changed, rather simplified,
							the way things can be done. One such example would be a chrome extension that I developed named “PCShot”. We all want
							to access anything from anywhere in easy steps with a few clicks. Now, for a screenshot in PC to be accessed from
							mobile involves quite a number of steps. But PCShot bypasses all of these in a single click. Clicking on this chrome
							extension captures the webpage, and it sends it to the user's mobile device's gallery. All in one click!. Though this
							extension is not yet in the store, I myself have used it several times while paying electricity, cooking gas and mobile
							bills online where some transaction id is recommended to be noted. I just click on my PCShot and BOOM!. I need not
							take down anything by hand.<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne thing that
							never fails astonishing me is the analogy of computer science to the real world things. For instance, it was the time
							when I was learning types of memory in computer architecture that I was introduced to topics like Auxiliary memory,
							Main memory, Cache memory. Thinking to one level above, it showed me how analogous it is to the functioning of our
							brain as we try to recollect some incident. Scrupulous observation of how humans think by the researchers might have
							brought this way of organization of memory in computers. It might sound naive but such simple analogies always remind
							me that great ideas are reflections of daily life happenings provided we think a step above! This is just one of the
							many analogies I have observed. Many such analogies helped me in understanding the subject to a few levels deeper
							and also reinforced my teaching skills. <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI
							believe that I am capable of explaining technical concepts effectively to others. The base for this skill came from
							my father, a great orator himself, who encouraged me to participate in different elocution competitions right from
							my schooling. It powered itself further as I utilised every opportunity to share my knowledge with others not just
							to whet my pedagogical skills but also because of the immense passion I have for the same. I was elated when asked
							to take a few classes like web application development using Python, Android app development, interview preparation
							techniques, etc., to my juniors at college. Teaching them made me feel contented because there is this mutual learning
							happening when questions are raised to the words spoken by my understanding of a concept. Such a learning atmosphere
							has pushed me further to think deeper.
							<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI was the Google Student Ambassador and a
							president of Google Developers Club from our college as a part of which I conducted 2-day workshop for our juniors
							on Android App development. At the end of workshop, I made sure each student developed a simple application by connecting
							their app to cloud. Being the head of our college's technical fest in my final year was another milestone in my learning
							as it requires a lot of teamwork, patience and ability to manage multiple tasks ubiquitously. But things became more
							convoluted as I have been simultaneously working as an intern. I had to spend at least 3-4 hours either in the morning
							session or in the evening session apart from my 9-hour work at that company to ensure successful execution of events
							on the day of fest. <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy communication skills
							have always been forte in allowing people to understand me precisely what I meant. Being a non-native speaker of English,
							I had to learn these skills the hard way. It was in my high school (9th grade) that I failed in English exam by 3
							marks. I couldn’t take it when my teacher gave me pity marks just so that I can pass. It was then that I developed
							passion and zeal to improve my English speaking ability. In our school, though there were strict rules for students
							to speak only in English, it was hardly followed by students, including me, as we were more comfortable in our native
							language. However, since my 9th grade, I have spent substantial time to improve my English and have thus become quite
							proficient.
							<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI am currently working as a Software Engineer
							at Accolite Software India Pvt Ltd. for less than a year after completing 6 months of internship in the same. Accolite
							helped me in whetting the quality of code which I write. Before joining Accolite, though I used to give importance
							to the complexity of the solution, I neglected the coding conventions to some extent which must actually be followed
							to develop a readable code. I could finally overcome this at my workplace. Mainly, when contributing to developing
							a software, I learned how well a code should be written in a way so that it can be well maintained.<br>
